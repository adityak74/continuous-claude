# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 7: "How it works" intro sentence
- Before: "This script automates the entire PR lifecycle—from code changes to merged commits—using Claude Code to drive iterative development:"
- After: "Using Claude Code to drive iterative development, this script fully automates the PR lifecycle from code changes through to merged commits:"
- Key changes: Led with Claude Code for clarity, used "fully automates" for emphasis, "through to" for better flow

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
- Lines 9-15: The workflow bullet points could use parallel structure (all start with same verb tense)
